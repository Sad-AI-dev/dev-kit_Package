# dev-kit Library
A library for unity containing reusable scripts, aimed to speed up prototyping.  
The library contains scripts in 4 categories: Controllers, Behaviors, Systems, and Utils.

The categories are defined as such:
- **Controllers**
	- This category contains scripts that recieve inputs from the player, or are foundations for player or entity controllers.
- **Behaviours**
	- These are single monobehaviour scripts that execute a specific behaviour.
- **Systems**
	- This category contains bundles of scripts that work together to create a framework or system.
- **Utils**
	- These scripts aim to smooth over development or make something more convenient to work with.
