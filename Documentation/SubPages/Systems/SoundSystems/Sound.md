It has the following features:  

- **Clip** *AudioClip*  
The sound that can be played.
- **Output** *Audio Mixer Group*  
The output audio mixer group, works identical to the *AudioSource* output mixer group.
- **Priority** *int*  
Determines the priority of this audio source among all the ones that coexist in the scene.  
(Priority: 0 = most important. 256 = least important. Default = 128.). Use 0 for music tracks to avoid it getting occasionally swapped out.
- **Volume** *float*  
The volume of the sound.
- **Pitch** *float*  
The pitch of the sound.
- **BypassEffects** *bool*  
Bypass effects (Applied from filter components or global listener filters).
- **BypassListenerEffects** *bool*  
When set global effects on the AudioListener will not be applied to the audio signal generated by the AudioSource. Does not apply if the AudioSource is playing into a mixer group.
- **BypassReverbZones** *bool*  
When set doesn't route the signal from an AudioSource into the global reverb associated with reverb zones.
