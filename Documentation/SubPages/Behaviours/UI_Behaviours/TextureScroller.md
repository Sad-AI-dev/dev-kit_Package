## Texture Scroller
The Texture Scroller is a behaviour that scrolls and loops a UI image.  
For the best result, set the sprite *Wrap Mode* to *Repeat* in its import settings.  
It has the following features:

- **Scroll Speed** *float*  
Determines the speed the image is scrolled at.

- **Scroll Direction** *Vector2*  
Determines which direction the image is scrolled in.  
This value is normalized.
